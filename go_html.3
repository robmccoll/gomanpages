.PP
EscapeString escapes special characters like "<" to become "&lt;". 
It escapes only five such characters: <, >, &, \(fm and ". 
UnescapeString(EscapeString(s)) == s always holds, but the converse isn't always true. 
.PP
.BR "func UnescapeString(" "s" " string) string"
.PP
UnescapeString unescapes entities like "&lt;" to become "<". 
It unescapes a larger range of entities than EscapeString escapes. 
For example, "&aacute;" unescapes to "รก", as does "&#225;" and "&xE1;". 
UnescapeString(EscapeString(s)) == s always holds, but the converse isn't always true.
