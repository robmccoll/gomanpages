.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Package scanner implements a scanner for Go source text. 
It takes a []byte as source which can then be tokenized through repeated calls to the Scan method. 
.SH "FUNCTIONS"
.PP
.BR "func PrintError(" "w" " io.Writer, " "err" " error)"
.PP
PrintError is a utility function that prints a list of errors to w, one error per line, if the err parameter is an ErrorList. 
Otherwise it prints the err string. 
.SH "TYPES"
.SS "Error"
.B type Error struct {
.RS
.B Pos token.Position
.sp 0
.B Msg string
.RE
.B }
.PP
In an ErrorList, an error is represented by an *Error. 
The position Pos, if valid, points to the beginning of the offending token, and the error condition is described by Msg. 
.PP
.BR "func (Error) Error() string"
.PP
Error implements the error interface. 
.SS "ErrorHandler"
.B type ErrorHandler func(pos token.Position, msg string)
.PP
An ErrorHandler may be provided to Scanner.Init. 
If a syntax error is encountered and a handler was installed, the handler is called with a position and an error message. 
The position points to the beginning of the offending token. 
.SS "ErrorList"
.B type ErrorList []*Error
.PP
ErrorList is a list of *Errors. 
The zero value for an ErrorList is an empty ErrorList ready to use. 
.PP
.BR "func (*ErrorList) Add(" "pos" " token.Position, " "msg" " string)"
.PP
Add adds an Error with given position and error message to an ErrorList. 
.PP
.BR "func (ErrorList) Err() error"
.PP
Err returns an error equivalent to this error list. 
If the list is empty, Err returns nil. 
.PP
.BR "func (ErrorList) Error() string"
.PP
An ErrorList implements the error interface. 
.PP
.BR "func (ErrorList) Len() int"
.PP
ErrorList implements the sort Interface. 
.PP
.BR "func (ErrorList) Less(" "i" ", " "j" " int) bool"
.PP
.BR "func (*ErrorList) RemoveMultiples()"
.PP
RemoveMultiples sorts an ErrorList and removes all but the first error per line. 
.PP
.BR "func (*ErrorList) Reset()"
.PP
Reset resets an ErrorList to no errors. 
.PP
.BR "func (ErrorList) Sort()"
.PP
Sort sorts an ErrorList. 
*Error entries are sorted by position, other errors are sorted by error message, and before any *Error entry. 
.PP
.BR "func (ErrorList) Swap(" "i" ", " "j" " int)"
.SS "Mode"
.B type Mode uint
.PP
A mode value is a set of flags (or 0). 
They control scanner behavior. 
.PP
.B const (

.B ScanComments 
.sp 0

.SS "Scanner"
.B type Scanner struct {
.RS
.B ErrorCount int
.sp 0

.PP
A Scanner holds the scanner's internal state while processing a given text. 
It can be allocated as part of another data structure but must be initialized via Init before use. 
.PP
.BR "func (*Scanner) Init(" "file" " *token.File, " "src" " []byte, " "err" " ErrorHandler, " "mode" " Mode)"
.PP
Init prepares the scanner s to tokenize the text src by setting the scanner at the beginning of src. 
The scanner uses the file set file for position information and it adds line information for each line. 
It is ok to re\-use the same file when re\-scanning the same file as line information which is already present is ignored. 
Init causes a panic if the file size does not match the src size. 
.PP
Calls to Scan will invoke the error handler err if they encounter a syntax error and err is not nil. 
Also, for each error encountered, the Scanner field ErrorCount is incremented by one. 
The mode parameter determines how comments are handled. 
.PP
Note that Init may call err if there is an error in the first character of the file. 
.PP
.BR "func (*Scanner) Scan() (" "pos" " token.Pos, " "tok" " token.Token, " "lit" " string)"
.PP
Scan scans the next token and returns the token position, the token, and its literal string if applicable. 
The source end is indicated by token.EOF. 
.PP
If the returned token is a literal (token.IDENT, token.INT, token.FLOAT, token.IMAG, token.CHAR, token.STRING) or token.COMMENT, the literal string has the corresponding value. 
.PP
If the returned token is a keyword, the literal string is the keyword. 
.PP
If the returned token is token.SEMICOLON, the corresponding literal string is ";" if the semicolon was present in the source, and "\en" if the semicolon was inserted because of a newline or at EOF. 
.PP
If the returned token is token.ILLEGAL, the literal string is the offending character. 
.PP
In all other cases, Scan returns an empty literal string. 
.PP
For more tolerant parsing, Scan will return a valid token if possible even if a syntax error was encountered. 
Thus, even if the resulting token sequence contains no illegal tokens, a client may not assume that no error occurred. 
Instead it must check the scanner's ErrorCount or the number of calls of the error handler, if there was one installed. 
.PP
Scan adds line information to the file added to the file set with Init. 
Token positions are relative to that file and thus relative to the file set.
